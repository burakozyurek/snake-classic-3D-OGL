- This is another version of self educational 3D OpenGL game development trial by me which was done years ago.
- It is probably required to install OpenGL C++ development library and GLFW to run without any problems.
- It may alert your antivirus software. Compiled program does not contain any harmful software. You can compile by yourself the game if you want.
- Source code does not contain comment lines but feel free to ask information.
- Known bugs: The camera losing tracking after a while. Feel free to notify any if you encounter.
- How to play: With arrow keys.
- Properties of the game:
  1. Magnificent 3D graphics.
  2. Collision walls.
  3. Random placed obstacles.
  4. Excellent soundtrack and sound effects 'absolutely' produced by me.
